BayesGAM is a fork of pyGAM with the addition of Bayessian estimations. This is a dropin replacement of pyGAM. This is a package for building Generalized Additive Models in Python, with an emphasis on modularity and performance. The API will be immediately familiar to anyone with experience of scikit-learn or scipy.

## Installation

BayesGAM is on PyPi, and can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install bayesgam
```

Alternatively, you can install it via `conda-forge` (although this is typically less up-to-date):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge BayesGAM
```

To install the bleeding edge version from GitHub using `uv`:

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the main directory.
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
pip install uv
uv build
```

### Optional

To speed up optimization on large models with constraints, it helps to have `scikit-sparse` installed because it contains a slightly faster, sparse version of Cholesky factorization. The import from `scikit-sparse` references `nose`, so you'll need that too.

The easiest way is to use Conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-sparse nose
```

More information is available in the [scikit-sparse docs](http://pythonhosted.org/scikit-sparse/overview.html#download).

## Dependencies

BayesGAM is tested on Python 2.7 and 3.6 and depends on `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `progressbar2` (see `requirements.txt` for version information).

Optional: `scikit-sparse`.

In addition to the above dependencies, the `datasets` submodule relies on `Pandas`.
